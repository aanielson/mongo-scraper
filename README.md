# All The News That's Fit to Scrape

## Description
Whenever a user visits this app, it scrapes the most recent stories from Deseret News and displays them for the user. Each scraped article is saved to the application database, then displayed using a GET request. Users then have the option to save an article, which PUTs it in the "Saved" collection. This collection of saved articles is displayed on the "Saved" page. Here, users can POST comments on their saved articles.
